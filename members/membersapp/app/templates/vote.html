            <p>Votes will be counted using the "Scottish Single Transferable Vote"
            (ScottishSTV) election method system. STV is a form of proportional
            representation. You should vote for the candidates in order of
            preference. If your preferred candidate has no chance of being elected
            or has enough votes already, your vote is transferred to your second
            choice candidate in accordance with your instructions.</p>

            <p>A full description of the algorithm used is specified in
            <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2007/42/schedule/1/part/III/crossheading/counting-of-votes/made">Rules 45-52 of

            Conceptually, the election will be broken into a series of pairwise
            races between each possible paring of the candidates. If one candidate
            beats each of the others in pairwise races, that candidate wins.
            Otherwise, the "Cloneproof/Schwartz Sequential Dropping" method is
            employed to choose the most preferred candidate from those remaining.
            Some background reading on preferential voting and Condorcet is
            <a href="http://www.electionmethods.org/">available online</a>.</p>

            <p>As such, you are being asked to vote your preferences by ranking the
            candidates. Your preference will best be shown when you specify <strong>
            all</strong> candidates, in order of preference (i.e. &quot;XYZWTUV&quot;, X being
            the most preferred). Voting &quot;XY&quot; states that you prefer candidate X to Y.
