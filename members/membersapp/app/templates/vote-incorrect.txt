Dear {{ user.name }},

The system detected that the vote you created to be run today is not
configured properly.

For an election to run, it must have at least one ballots, and every
of its ballots must have at least 2 configured options.

Please go to https://members.spi-inc.org/vote/{{ vote.ref }}/edit to
correctly configure this vote.

The system has increased the starting date by 3 days so that you can
edit the vote.
