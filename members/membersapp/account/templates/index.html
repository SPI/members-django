<h2>Permissions model</h2>
<p>
News, Events, Products and Professional Services are attached to an
Organisation. One or more persons can be given permissions to manage
the data for an organisation. If you do not have permissions for an
organisation and think you should have, you need to contact the current
managers for that organisation. You can find a list of organisations
and managers <a href="orglist/">here</a>.
